    description: "At the top of our list solely because it’s the most iconic location in not only Sydney, but the entire continent of Australia. You could choose to embark on a variety of tours (at a variety of prices of course - $28++ for students), or you could even catch a live show ($60-$300) in this unique feat of architectural design.",
    moreDescription: "That’s fun and all, but if you’re on a tight budget, consider just catching a stroll around this famous landmark while at the same time, crossing it off your mandatory Selfie checklist. Also good to note that there are heaps of other interesting places to visit only a stone throw away from the Opera House such as the Harbour Bridge and the Rocks, so consider visiting these places on the same day.",

We’d recommend you do this while enjoying a beautiful sun set in order to get the most out of this experience. Right after, you could perhaps drop by Luna Park for a few rides!",

Some tickets are free, but of course payment is required for the cooler exhibits.",

There are displays, hands-on exhibits, a cinema and the latest museum computer games. Guided tours at no cost.",
